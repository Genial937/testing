### White box testing

Tests the internal code structure and logic of the software.

### Unit Testing

Tests individual units or components of the software to ensure they are functioning as intended.

### Integration Testing

Tests the integration of different components of the software to ensure they work together as a system.

### Functional Testing

Tests the functional requirements of the software to ensure they are met.

### Regression Testing

Tests the software after changes or modifications have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.

### Performance Testing

Tests the software to determine its performance characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.

### Security Testing

Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure it meets security requirements.

## Software Testing Objectives

- The process of investigating and checking a program to find whether there is an error or not and does it fulfill the requirements or not is called testing.
- When the number of errors found during the testing is high, it indicates that the testing was good and is a sign of good test case.
- Finding an unknown error that wasnâ€™t discovered yet is a sign of a successful and a good test case.

The main objective of software testing is to design the tests in such a way that it systematically finds different types of errors without taking much time and effort so that less time is required for the development of the software.
